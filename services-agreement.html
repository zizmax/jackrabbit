								<p>Jackrabbit Cleaning LLC Services Agreement 
									Updated Date: October 22, 2021
									
									Terms
									This Service Policy constitute a legally binding agreement (the “Agreement”) between you and Jackrabbit Cleaning LLC (“Jackrabbit Cleaning,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) that governs your access or use of the applications, websites, content, products, and services (collectively, the “Jackrabbit Cleaning Platform”) made available by Jackrabbit Cleaning.
									
									Any persons (whether individual, company, or entity) hereby referred to as a you, user, customer, and/or client, who books a service with Jackrabbit Cleaning in any way including but not limited to over the website, email, phone call, text message, or in-person is agreeing to the terms set forth by this document.
									
									By entering into to this Agreement, you expressly acknowledge that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE Jackrabbit Cleaning PLATFORM.
									
									Platform
									Jackrabbit Cleaning PROVIDES A MARKETPLACE PLATFORM where persons seeking home services (“Service Requesters” or “Requesters”) can be matched with persons, companies, or entities offering home services (“Service Providers” or “Providers”). 
									All Requestors requesting or accepting services from Jackrabbit Cleaning are aware Jackrabbit Cleaning is a platform and not a service provider. The Service Provider is being hired to fulfill a duty outside of the competency of Jackrabbit Cleaning. Service Providers will be responsible for fulfilling services assigned to them based on their selected criteria through the Jackrabbit Cleaning platform. Any decision by a Requestor to accept Services is a decision made in such Requester’s sole discretion. Each Service provided by a Provider to a Requester shall constitute a separate agreement between such persons and/or entities.
									
									Retaining Services Directly from Contractors and Recruitment
									Contracted house cleaners working with Jackrabbit Cleaning have agreed, in writing, that they or their family and friends will not accept direct employment from any Customer of Jackrabbit Cleaning except for tips given at the time of the service. This agreement is effective during the time that professional house cleaners are working with Jackrabbit Cleaning and for a period of one year after the termination of their agreement with Jackrabbit Cleaning. Given this, we ask that you do not directly solicit or engage the service of any professional house cleaner, except through Jackrabbit Cleaning.
									
									If you wish to retain services directly from or to directly recruit a Jackrabbit Cleaning independent contractor, you will be charged a $1750.00 referral fee. This fee is approximate to one year of recurring service revenue from a given client. Once the Customer has paid the referral fee, Jackrabbit Cleaning will no longer be responsible for monitoring and managing the contractor, including, but not limited to liability protection, information security, scheduling, government taxes, quality of services, and any other act pertaining to the daily work duties of the contractor.
									
									Modification to the Agreement
									Jackrabbit Cleaning reserves the right to modify this agreement. Such modifications shall become effective upon posting. In the event Jackrabbit Cleaning modifies the terms and conditions of this Agreement, such modifications shall be binding on you only upon your acceptance of the modified Agreement. Continued use of the Jackrabbit Cleaning Platform or Services after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes.
									
									Right of Refusal
									Jackrabbit Cleaning reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason. These reasons include but are not limited to: not being able to gain entry to a home, no power, no electricity, no air conditioning or heating, frequent cancellations or schedule changes, improper or dishonest booking, project out of scope of the original booking, not listing all the bedrooms, bathrooms or total sqft (even if we’re not cleaning them), being rude to staff or Providers, poaching or attempting to poach Providers away from Jackrabbit Cleaning (at any price), and/or incorrect or non-functioning billing information.
									
									Appointment Confirmations
									Once a booking has been processed online it must be manually confirmed. If Jackrabbit Cleaning can’t confirm an appointment, the appointment may be canceled. At which time the Requester will receive a cancellation notice. An open time slot doesn’t guarantee a Provider will be available and/or the job/service will be confirmed.
									
									Any confirmation emails which may have been received are subject to change. Meaning, an appoint which was once confirmed can become unconfirmed depending on circumstances. Jackrabbit Cleaning is not bound to perform a service even if the service has been confirmed.
									
									Jackrabbit Cleaning Satisfaction Assurance
									The Jackrabbit Cleaning Satisfaction Assurance hereby referred to as “Assurance” is available to Requesters and is the sole liability of Jackrabbit Cleaning to Requesters for the performance of Services as described in the Jackrabbit Cleaning Process Overview. If you are not satisfied with the quality of the initial Service requested and paid for through the Jackrabbit Cleaning Platform, then Jackrabbit Cleaning will send a Provider to correct areas of the original service that were missed/overlooked at no additional charge to the Requester.
